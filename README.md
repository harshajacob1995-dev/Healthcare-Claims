# Healthcare-Claims
Healthcare claims cost analysis dashboard built in Power BI to identify cost drivers, high-cost members, and reimbursement inefficiencies. Analyzes claim types, CPT/ICD codes, and paid vs billed patterns to help executives understand where money is being lost and support profitability decisions.


# Healthcare Claims Cost Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes healthcare claims data to identify where the insurer is losing money and uncover key drivers of high healthcare spending. The dashboard helps C-level executives understand cost patterns, reimbursement efficiency, and opportunities to improve profitability.

The analysis focuses on claim types, procedures (CPT), diagnoses (ICD), high-cost members, and billed vs paid discrepancies.
